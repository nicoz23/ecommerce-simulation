Ecommerce - Project by Nicolás Zunino

This project is a simulation of an online store developed by Nicolás Zunino, with the main goal of integrating modern technologies to create a functional e-commerce platform. While still in the development stage, it provides a solid foundation for showcasing web development skills.
Main Features

    Complete Product Management (CRUD): The administrator can create, read, update, and delete products in the catalog, enabling full inventory management.
    Usage of FakeStoreAPI: The project consumes data from FakeStoreAPI to simulate a product catalog with categories, prices, images, and descriptions.
    Frontend in ReactJS: The application is built with ReactJS, ensuring a dynamic, interactive, and modern user experience.
    Payment Integration (in progress): The integration with MercadoPago is currently being developed, which will allow users to securely make transactions directly on the platform.

Current Limitations

Although the project works as a simulation, there are areas that need improvement:

    Payment Gateway: The integration with MercadoPago is still pending.
    FakeStoreAPI Limitations: While FakeStoreAPI is useful for simulating a product catalog, it doesn't support advanced operations like adding products to the cart in a functional way. These actions only return static responses (200 OK), limiting the user experience. To address this, the development of a custom API is planned to allow full control over operations and improve response times.

Technologies Used

    ReactJS: Framework for frontend development.
    FakeStoreAPI: For simulating the product catalog.
    CSS / TailwindCSS: For styling and frontend layout.
    MercadoPago: (Coming soon) Integration for online payments.

Project Objective

This e-commerce project aims to demonstrate how key technologies can be integrated into a single system, including product management, catalog simulation, and online payments. Although it currently uses a simulated API, the development of a custom API will turn this simulation into a more realistic and functional platform.
